  <div class="subtitle">
    <p>The challenges that students face while studying.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="first">
    <h3>How does mental health affect students?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Mental health problems can affect a student's energy level, concentration, dependability, mental ability, and optimism, and hindering performance. Mental health problems also cause students to drop out and have suicidal thoughts. Not only for the students, it also affects family members of the student, the school/campus, and the society.</p>
    <br><br>
  </div>

  <div class="ADHD">
    <h3>ADHD in learning</h3>
    <br>
    <p>ADHD can affect a student's ability to focus, pay attention, listen, or put effort into schoolwork. ADHD also can make a student fidgety, restless, talk too much, or disrupt the class. Kids with ADHD might also have learning disabilities that cause them to have problems in school.</p>
    <br><br>
  </div>

  <div class="Depression">
    <h3>Depression in learning</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Research suggests that depression is associated with lower grade point averages, and that co-occurring depression and anxiety can increase this association. Depression has also been linked to dropping out of school. This is because depression can impair their attention and memory, as well as their information processing and decision-making skills. It can also lower their cognitive flexibility (the ability to adapt your goals and strategies to changing situations) and executive functioning (the ability to take all the steps to get something done).</p>
    <br><br>
  </div>
  
   <div class="Anxiety">
    <h3>Anxiety in learning</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Students with anxiety disorder display a passive attitude in their studies such as lack of interest in learning, poor performance in exams, and on assignments.</p>
    <br><br>
  </div>

   <div class="OCD">
    <h3>OCD in learning</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Students with OCD may struggle to focus in class or complete assignments while frequently feeling the need to perform rituals like hand-washing, rewriting sentences or reorganizing notes. Intrusive thoughts can also be disruptive to the learning process, not to mention distressing.</p>

     <div class="Dyslexia">
    <h3>Dyslexia in learning</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that mainly causes problems with reading, writing and spelling. It's a specific learning difficulty, which means it causes problems with certain abilities used for learning, such as reading and writing. Unlike a learning disability, intelligence isn't affected.</p>
